This project implements various sorting algorithms in JavaScript. 
It includes popular algorithms such as:
Bubble Sort: Simple, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts, then merges them.
Quick Sort: Divides the array based on a pivot and sorts the partitions.

Each algorithm is demonstrated with step-by-step execution, and the code is optimized for readability and performance. 
Feel free to explore and contribute!
